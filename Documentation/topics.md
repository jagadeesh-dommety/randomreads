A human drama of cognitive bias + probability explained through a game show.

25. How dust storms on Mars helped demonstrate Gaussian distribution

A real example of noise, randomness, and natural variation forming a perfect bell curve.

26. The Central Limit Theorem: why everything in the world eventually becomes “normal”

A story told through exam scores, factory defects, and average human height.

27. How Gauss predicted the orbit of a lost asteroid using a single distribution curve

A dramatic rescue mission for a runaway celestial rock using pure math.

28. How a measurement error in the 1700s created a perfect case study of Gaussian noise

The world’s first real dataset that fit a bell curve almost magically.

29. Why normal distribution explains why extreme talent and extreme failure are rare

Sports, music, stock markets — the mathematics of “averaging out.”

30. When a statistician proved that “perfect fairness” is impossible

A philosophical story on randomness, bias, and why truly random coins don’t exist.
