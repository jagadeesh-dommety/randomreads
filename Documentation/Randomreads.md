# RandomReads

RandomReads is a minimalist app designed for quick and engaging reading. It features content under 1200 characters, perfect for a ~90-second read. The reads span diverse topics such as science, astronomy, software, AI, movies (e.g., Harry Potter, Star Wars, Marvel, DC), TV series (e.g., Friends, Stranger Things, anime), and sports like soccer. 

This text-only app minimizes distractions with limited social media features—allowing only like, report, and share options.

The user interface is clean and straightforward, offering a seamless single-page/tab experience. RandomReads is available on both iOS and Android platforms.

Immediate sign-in is not required, will prompt in 2nd day or so!
