Lizards Evolved New Digestive Systems in 36 Years After Being Moved to a Different Island
Italian wall lizards introduced to Pod Mrčaru island in 1971; by 2007 they'd evolved cecal valves (new organs) to digest plant matter; evolution creating new anatomy in human lifespan.
Peppered Moths Went From White to Black in 50 Years—Then Back to White When Pollution Stopped
Industrial Revolution soot made white moths visible to predators; black variant went from 2% to 98% in Manchester by 1895; Clean Air Act reversed it by 1970; evolution rewinding itself.
New York City Mice Evolved to Eat Pizza and Hot Dogs in 200 Years
Manhattan white-footed mice have different genes for metabolizing fatty foods than rural cousins; separate populations in Central Park vs. downtown show convergent urban evolution; junk food shaped their DNA.
Ash Trees Are Evolving Resistance to the Fungus Killing Them—In Real Time
Ash dieback fungus arrived in UK 2012; by 2019 some trees showing genetic resistance; evolution as emergency response; forests adapting faster than scientists expected.

Bedbugs Evolved Thicker Shells to Resist Pesticides—In 4 Years
New York City bedbug resurgence 2005-2009; evolved 250x resistance to pyrethroids; exoskeleton changes measurable under microscope; evolution defeating human chemistry.

Your Placenta Exists Because Ancient Mammals Got Infected by a Virus
Syncytin genes came from retrovirus that infected mammal ancestors 150 million years ago; virus genes now essential for placenta formation; STI became survival mechanism; we're part virus.
Humans Got Pubic Lice From Gorillas 3.3 Million Years Ago
DNA analysis proves human pubic lice descended from gorilla lice; head lice are different species; happened when humans lost body hair but kept pubic/armpit hair; lice reveal evolutionary timeline.

The Giraffe's Laryngeal Nerve Takes a 15-Foot Detour—Because Fish Don't Have Necks
Nerve loops under aortic arch in fish ancestors; as necks lengthened, nerve stayed looped; now travels down giraffe's neck and back up—ridiculous efficiency failure proving evolution tinkers, doesn't design.
Whales Have Finger Bones in Their Flippers—Leftover From When They Had Legs
Whale ancestors walked on land 50 million years ago; modern whales have complete five-fingered hand skeletons hidden in flippers; some species have leftover pelvic bones and femurs; evolution never erases completely.
