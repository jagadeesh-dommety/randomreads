---------------------------------------------------------

"The "Anastassakis" Nod: A Greek wedding listed on a hotel board in the series finale used Jennifer Aniston’s real family name.
The "Ross-Rachel" Crush Was Real: The actors admitted they had major crushes on each other in Season 1, but "channeled" that energy into their characters because they were never both single at the same time.
The Peephole Frame Was a Mistake: The iconic gold frame originally held a mirror. A crew member broke it, but the producers liked the "empty" look so much they kept it on the door.
The "Reserved" Sign Theory: Fans often wondered how the group always got the best seat in a busy NYC cafe. A subtle "Reserved" sign is frequently visible on the Central Perk table.
The Orange Couch Found in a Basement: The central set piece was a dusty sofa found in the Warner Bros. storage basement.
The "Last Night of Anonymity": Before the pilot aired, director James Burrows took the cast to Las Vegas, warning them it was their last chance to visit a casino without being mobbed.
Monica’s Apartment Numbers Changed: Her door was #5 in early episodes. Producers changed it to #20 (and Joey’s from #4 to #19) to better reflect a top-floor unit.
The "Rachel" Haircut Phenomenon: Jennifer Aniston famously hated the layered haircut that became a global fashion trend.
The "Monica-Chandler" Pivot: Their hookup was meant to be a one-night stand. The live audience reaction in London was so intense (screaming for nearly 30 seconds) that writers made them a permanent couple.

Joey and Phoebe’s Secret Affair: Lisa Kudrow and Matt LeBlanc pitched an ending where it was revealed their characters had been secretly hooking up the entire 10 years.

Ugly Naked Guy Identified: His identity remained a mystery until 2016, when he was revealed to be an extra named Jon Haugen.
Monica’s Yelling Jar: A "Yelling Jar" (similar to a swear jar) is visible in the kitchen of the restaurant where Monica works.
The "Arquette" Credits: After Courteney Cox married David Arquette, the entire cast added "Arquette" to their names in the opening credits of the next episode as a tribute.
Ross’s "Pivot!" Delivery: David Schwimmer’s screaming delivery of the line was largely unscripted and fueled by the genuine difficulty of moving the heavy prop.
The One Where No One's Ready: This "bottle episode" (filmed in one room) was created solely because the show had run out of budget for guest stars or extra sets that week.
The "Home Alone" House: Monica and Chandler’s Westchester house used the same exterior view and background house as the McCallister home in Home Alone.
Marcel Was a Nightmare: The monkey trainers were so possessive that the cast wasn't allowed to bond with him, leading David Schwimmer to "hate" working with the animal.
The Cast Still Can't Watch: Several cast members admit they find it difficult to watch the show today because it brings up too many personal memories of their 10 years together.
