It was her pants.White pants. Fitted. Professional. And completely ruined by visible panty lines and the thick seam where her pantyhose ended mid-thigh. She twisted in the mirror, trying different angles. Nothing worked. Every outline showed. She looked lumpy. Unprofessional. She had a pitch meeting in an hour.She grabbed scissors from the drawer.The Desperate SolutionStanding in her pantyhose, she cut. Snip. Snip. The reinforced toe section fell away.

Sara wrote it down in her journal that night: "Footless pantyhose. For pants. Someone should make this."Then she realized: She should make this.The Research Phase: $5,000 and Zero Experience
