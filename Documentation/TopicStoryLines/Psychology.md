"The Stanford Prison Experiment Went So Wrong They Stopped It After 6 Days—Then Lied About It 1971: Zimbardo assigned students guard or prisoner roles in fake prison; guards became sadistic within 48 hours; prisoners had breakdowns; stopped early when girlfriend visited, saw abuse; decades later: revealed Zimbardo coached guards to be cruel, cherry-picked data; experiment = less about human nature, more about demand characteristics and bad science.",

"The Milgram Shock Experiment—65% of People Killed a Stranger Because a Scientist Said To 1961: participants told to shock learner (actor) for wrong answers; shocks escalated to lethal 450 volts; 65% went to maximum despite screams; thought they killed someone; proved ordinary people obey authority even when harming others; conducted 3 months after Eichmann trial; just following orders isn't defense—it's human default.",

"The Marshmallow Test Didn't Prove What Everyone Thinks—It Measured Privilege, Not Willpower
1970s: kids offered marshmallow now or two later; famous finding: waiters became more successful; 2018 replication: self-control correlated with family income, not future success; rich kids could wait because they trusted adults would return; poor kids ate immediately (rational—resources scarce); lesson about inequality, not discipline.",

"The Little Albert Experiment—Psychology's Most Unethical Study Created a Lifelong Phobia
1920: John Watson conditioned 9-month-old baby to fear white rats by pairing rat with loud noise; Albert developed phobia of rats, rabbits, fur, beards; never deconditioned him; mother removed Albert from study; he died age 6 (meningitis); Watson's career destroyed for ethics violations; proved classical conditioning in humans, at terrible cost.",

"The Mandela Effect—Thousands Share Identical False Memories
Collective false memories: "Berenstain Bears" remembered as "Berenstein," Mandela's death in prison (he didn't), "Luke, I am your father" (actually "No, I am your father"); explanations: confabulation, source confusion, parallel universes (fringe); psychology: memory is social, suggestible, reconstructive; consensus doesn't equal truth.",

"Loss Aversion: Losing $100 Hurts More Than Finding $100 Feels Good
Kahneman & Tversky: losses loom larger than gains (ratio ~2:1); people reject 50/50 bets to win $150 or lose $100 (irrational); explains endowment effect, status quo bias, sunk cost fallacy; evolved psychology: survival favored avoiding loss over seeking gain; marketers exploit this mercilessly.",

"Your Brain Decides 7 Seconds Before You "Consciously" Choose—Free Will Might Be Illusion
Benjamin Libet (1980s): EEG showed brain activity (readiness potential) 350 milliseconds before subjects "decided" to move finger; later studies: fMRI predicted choices 7-10 seconds before conscious awareness; implications: consciousness = narrator, not author; legal/moral responsibility questioned; debate still raging.",

"The Woman Who Remembers Every Day of Her Life—And Wishes She Could Forget
Jill Price (2006): hyperthymesia = autobiographical memory of every day since age 14; remembers what she wore, ate, weather, news; can't turn it off; OCD-like rumination; emotional events replay constantly; blessing = curse; only ~60 documented cases; memory doesn't equal intelligence (she's average IQ); proves forgetting = mental health necessity.",

"False Memories Sent Innocent People to Prison—Satanic Panic of the 1980s
Therapists using "recovered memory" techniques implanted false memories of childhood abuse, satanic rituals; McMartin preschool trial (1983-90): no evidence, children's testimony coached; dozens imprisoned, lives destroyed; Elizabeth Loftus proved false memories easily created; lesson: memory ≠ videotape, suggestibility real, therapeutic techniques can harm.",

"The Invisible Gorilla—Half of People Miss It Because Attention Is a Spotlight
1999: participants watch video, count basketball passes; person in gorilla suit walks through frame; 50% don't see gorilla; "inattentional blindness"; proves we see less than we think; implications: eyewitness testimony unreliable, distracted driving deadly; consciousness = narrow beam, not wide lens.",

"The Asch Conformity Experiment—75% of People Agreed With Obviously Wrong Answers to Fit In
1951: participants matched line lengths; confederates gave wrong answers unanimously; 75% conformed at least once despite knowing correct answer; 25% never conformed (independent thinkers rare); peer pressure overrides perception; explains groupthink, cults, political polarization.",

"The Robbers Cave Experiment—Researchers Turned Kids Into Enemies in 3 Days
1954: 22 boys at summer camp divided into groups; groups quickly developed hostility, raided each other, fought; researchers created superordinate goals (fix water supply together); conflict vanished when forced to cooperate; lesson: in-group/out-group identity forms instantly, dissolves with common purpose.",

"Harlow's Monkeys Chose Comfort Over Food—Proving Love Isn't Just About Survival
1950s-70s: baby rhesus monkeys given choice between wire "mother" with food or cloth "mother" with no food; babies clung to cloth mother, only visited wire for feeding; disproved behaviorist theory that attachment = food association; proved need for comfort, touch; experiments = animal cruelty by modern standards.",

"The Psychopath Test—1% of Population Lacks Empathy, Many Are CEOs
PCL-R (Psychopathy Checklist): 20% of male prisoners score high; general population ~1%; traits: superficial charm, manipulation, lack of remorse, shallow emotions; corporate psychopaths: 4-12% of executives (higher than prison); thrive in competitive, hierarchical systems; not all violent—many successful; lesson: empathy deficit ≠ criminality, can be "functional."",

"The Dark Triad—Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy Combined
Paulhus & Williams (2002): three overlapping traits predict exploitation, manipulation; narcissists seek admiration, Machiavellians seek power, psychopaths seek thrill; combination = toxic leadership, workplace bullying, fraud; presidents, CEOs score high; short-term success, long-term destruction; organizational psychology: screen for Dark Triad in hiring.",

"Why We Trust Confident Liars Over Honest Doubters" ,

"Why Crowds Turn Violent—Deindividuation Dissolves Personal Responsibility
Le Bon (1895), Zimbardo (1969): anonymity + group = loss of self-awareness and restraint; Stanford Halloween study: anonymous kids stole more candy; sports riots, mob violence, online harassment all show deindividuation; masks, uniforms, crowds = permission to act on impulses normally suppressed.",

"The Dunning-Kruger Effect—Incompetent People Don't Know They're Incompetent
1999 study: lowest performers vastly overestimate ability (bottom quartile thought they scored above average); requires competence to recognize incompetence; "double curse": unskilled + unaware; explains anti-vax, conspiracy theories, Dunning: "ignorance more confident than knowledge"; meta-ignorance = not knowing what you don't know."


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Priming Studies That Shaped Psychology Were Fake—The Replication Crisis
Famous claims: seeing elderly words makes you walk slower, holding warm coffee makes you judge people as warmer; 2010s replication attempts: most failed; "social priming" largely debunked; crisis revealed: small sample sizes, p-hacking, publication bias; field reformed methods; lesson: skepticism > charismatic findings.
The Implicit Association Test Claims You're Racist—Even If You're Not
IAT measures reaction times pairing faces with positive/negative words; claims to detect unconscious bias; problem: test-retest reliability low (inconsistent results), doesn't predict discriminatory behavior; 2017 meta-analysis: weak correlation with actual bias; lesson: implicit bias exists but IAT doesn't measure it well; popularized concept, questionable tool.
Your Memories Change Every Time You Remember Them—Reconsolidation Makes Past Unstable
Memory retrieval = reconstruction, not playback; each recall modifies memory slightly; Nader & Schafe (2000): blocking protein synthesis during recall erases fear memories in rats; humans: memories become malleable when retrieved; PTSD treatments exploit this; your childhood memories = edited versions, not originals.


The Kitty Genovese Murder—38 Witnesses Did Nothing (Except That's Not What Happened)
1964: woman stabbed outside Queens apartment; NYT reported 38 witnesses watched, none called police; story sparked "bystander effect" research; truth: far fewer witnesses, some did call police, story exaggerated; but research it inspired was real: diffusion of responsibility genuine phenomenon; myth useful, facts complicated.
The Third Wave Experiment—High School Teacher Accidentally Created Fascism in 5 Days
1967 California: Ron Jones showed students how Germans accepted Nazism; created movement with salutes, rules, in-group identity; students policed each other, reported "traitors"; by day 3, 200 students enrolled; Jones terrified, ended it by revealing they'd recreated fascism; students traumatized; documentary "Lesson Plan" (2011) reunited participants; scariest lesson: fascism emerges naturally from social psychology.
The Elevator Conformity Experiment—People Face Backwards Because Others Do
Candid Camera (1962): confederates in elevator face backward; lone subject turns around to match group; replicated countless times; demonstrates normative social influence (conformity to fit in); no words needed, just unspoken pressure; reveals how easily social norms override common sense.
Social Media Exploits Dopamine—Apps Are Slot Machines for Your Brain
Variable reward schedules (Skinner): most addictive reinforcement pattern; slot machines, gambling use this; social media: unpredictable likes/comments = same mechanism; pull-to-refresh = slot lever; tech designers admit intentional addiction; ex-Facebook exec: "we exploit vulnerability in human psychology"; notifications = intermittent reinforcement maximizing compulsion.
Why Crowds Turn Violent—Deindividuation Dissolves Personal Responsibility
Le Bon (1895), Zimbardo (1969): anonymity + group = loss of self-awareness and restraint; Stanford Halloween study: anonymous kids stole more candy; sports riots, mob violence, online harassment all show deindividuation; masks, uniforms, crowds = permission to act on impulses normally suppressed.
The Dunning-Kruger Effect—Incompetent People Don't Know They're Incompetent
1999 study: lowest performers vastly overestimate ability (bottom quartile thought they scored above average); requires competence to recognize incompetence; "double curse": unskilled + unaware; explains anti-vax, conspiracy theories, Dunning: "ignorance more confident than knowledge"; meta-ignorance = not knowing what you don't know.



Split-Brain Patients Have Two Consciousnesses—Left Hand Literally Doesn't Know What Right Is Doing
Corpus callosum severed (epilepsy treatment); left brain (language) and right brain (spatial) operate independently; show image to right brain only, patient can't name it but left hand draws it; two hemispheres = two minds; philosopher's nightmare: are you one person or two?; Sperry won Nobel 1981.

H.M. Forgot Everything After Surgery—But Could Learn New Skills
Henry Molaison (1953): hippocampus removed to treat epilepsy; lost ability to form new memories; couldn't remember meeting you 5 minutes later; but: learned mirror drawing task, improved daily, didn't remember practicing; proved multiple memory systems: declarative (conscious) vs. procedural (unconscious); most studied patient in neuroscience.

Clive Wearing's Memory Lasts 7 Seconds—He Thinks He Just Woke Up Every Moment
1985 viral encephalitis destroyed hippocampus; episodic memory span ~7-30 seconds; keeps diary: "I am awake for the first time" written hundreds of times, each crossed out moments later; recognizes wife emotionally (preserved implicit memory) but not consciously; "living in permanent present"; most severe amnesia documented.


Phineas Gage Survived Iron Rod Through His Brain—And His Personality Completely Changed
1848: railroad worker, explosion drove iron rod through skull (frontal lobe); survived, physically recovered; before: responsible, reliable; after: impulsive, profane, unreliable; proved frontal lobe controls personality, impulse control; modern analysis: damaged ventromedial prefrontal cortex (emotion regulation); "no longer Gage."
Blindsight—People Who See Without Knowing They See
V1 (primary visual cortex) damage = clinical blindness; but: patients navigate obstacles, guess object locations above chance; subcortical pathways (superior colliculus) process visual info unconsciously; consciousness ≠ perception; philosophical implications: zombie vision, awareness is separate from processing.


The Lucifer Effect—How Good People Turn Evil in Bad Situations
Zimbardo's book after Stanford Prison: evil isn't personality trait, it's situational; Abu Ghraib prison guards = normal soldiers in dehumanizing system; "bad apples" theory false; "bad barrels" create bad apples; My Lai massacre, Nazi bureaucrats, corporate fraud all show situational evil; lesson: systems matter more than individuals.
The Milgram Variations—Obedience Dropped to 10% When Authority Figure Wasn't Present
Follow-up studies: obedience varied by situation: authority in room (65%), authority by phone (21%), peer rebellion (10%); proximity to victim mattered; touch victim (30%), same room (40%), separate rooms (65%); shows obedience isn't personality—it's context; intervention point: remove authority or add dissenting voices.
Why Smart People Join Cults—IQ Doesn't Protect Against Influence
High intelligence ≠ immunity to persuasion; cults recruit during vulnerability (life transition, isolation, stress); tactics: love bombing, gradual commitment (foot-in-door), information control, sleep deprivation; Heaven's Gate, NXIVM, Scientology recruited doctors, lawyers, engineers; intelligence helps rationalize, doesn't prevent; everyone susceptible under right conditions.
Schadenfreude—Your Brain Lights Up When Rivals Fail
fMRI studies: ventral striatum (reward center) activates when envied person suffers misfortune; stronger for in-group vs. out-group; evolutionary psychology: rival's loss = relative gain; social media amplifies this (cancel culture); darkness: we enjoy others' pain when it elevates our status; "comparison is thief of joy" (and creator of malice).


Confirmation Bias—We See What We Expect and Ignore the Rest
Wason selection task (1960): people only test hypotheses confirming belief, ignore disconfirming evidence; explains conspiracy theories, political polarization, pseudoscience belief; information age paradox: more data → stronger biases (selective exposure); debiasing difficult: motivated reasoning, backfire effect; awareness doesn't cure, only mitigates.
The Sunk Cost Fallacy—Why We Throw Good Money After Bad
Escalation of commitment: continue investing in losing proposition because of prior investment; rational: costs already spent, irrelevant to future decisions; psychological: admitting mistake = cognitive dissonance, loss aversion; examples: Vietnam War, failed projects, bad relationships; "don't throw good money after bad" = hardest advice to follow.
The Halo Effect—Why Attractive People Seem Smarter and More Trustworthy
Thorndike (1920): positive trait (beauty) biases perception of other traits (intelligence, morality); attractive defendants get lighter sentences; good-looking candidates elected more often; reviews: teachers rate attractive students smarter; hiring: beautiful applicants preferred; unconscious bias: single trait contaminates entire judgment; "what is beautiful is good" stereotype.
Availability Heuristic—We Think Plane Crashes Are Common Because They're Memorable
Tversky & Kahneman: judging likelihood by ease of recall; vivid, recent, emotional events overestimated; terrorism kills fewer than vending machines, but we fear it more; explains: medical student syndrome, after news coverage phobias spike; media exploits this: "if it bleeds it leads"; statistical thinking = antidote, rarely used.
Anchoring Bias—The First Number You Hear Controls Your Judgment
Initial value influences subsequent estimates, even when irrelevant; experiments: show random number on wheel, ask "Is Gandhi's age at death higher or lower?" then estimate age; anchor biases estimate; real estate, salary negotiation, pricing all exploit anchoring; "first offer advantage"; hard to avoid even when aware.



The Brain Rewires Itself—London Taxi Drivers Grew Bigger Hippocampi
Maguire et al. (2000): London cabbies (who memorized 25,000 streets) had enlarged posterior hippocampus; changed with experience, not innate; neuroplasticity: brain = plastic, not fixed; stroke recovery, learning, meditation all reshape neural architecture; "neurons that fire together wire together" (Hebbian learning); age matters less than believed.
MDMA-Assisted Therapy Cured PTSD in 67%—By Reopening Critical Period
Phase 3 trials (2021): MDMA + therapy for PTSD; 67% no longer met diagnosis after 3 sessions; works by reducing amygdala activity, increasing trust/openness; allows reprocessing trauma without overwhelming fear; FDA breakthrough therapy designation; suggests critical periods can reopen; psychedelics + therapy = promising frontier.
