Your Phone Knows Where You Are by Talking to 4 Satellites 12,000 Miles Away
GPS triangulates position by measuring how long radio signals take from satellites; needs 4 satellites for 3D location; works because light travels at exactly 299,792,458 m/s; speed of light makes maps possible.


Google Maps Was Built Because Someone Was Late to a Party
2004: Lars Rasmussen kept getting lost in Sydney; frustrated, built "Where 2 Technologies"; Google bought it for maps; now 1 billion people use it daily; being directionally challenged created navigation for humanity.

Moore's Law: Computing Power Doubles Every 2 Years—And It's Finally Dying


GPS Was Kept Deliberately Inaccurate Until 2000—To Protect Military Secrets
"Selective Availability" made civilian GPS fuzzy (100m accuracy); President Clinton flipped the switch May 2000; overnight navigation jumped to 5-meter precision; Uber/Lyft became possible.


A Plane Shot Down Because GPS Was Secret Led to GPS Going Public
1983: Korean Air 007 drifted into Soviet airspace, shot down, 269 dead; Reagan declassified GPS for civilian aviation; one tragedy created the navigation system in your pocket.


The Spam Email Named After a Monty Python Sketch About Canned Meat
1970 skit had Vikings drowning out conversation singing "SPAM SPAM SPAM"; early internet users adopted it for messages that drown out real content; now 85% of all email is spam.


The First Touchscreen Was Invented Because a Scientist Hated Data Entry
1965: E.A. Johnson at UK Royal Radar built touch interface because typing radar data was tedious; invention ignored for decades; now you touch screens 2,617 times per day on average.

Gorilla Glass is aluminosilicate heated to 400°C then ion-exchanged; ranks 6.5 on Mohs hardness scale; only corundum (sapphire) and diamond can scratch it; you're carrying refined beach in your pocket.

GPS Satellites Would Fail in Days Without Einstein's Relativity
Satellites move at 8,700 mph and orbit 12,500 miles up; time moves 38 microseconds faster per day than on Earth; without relativity corrections, GPS would drift 6 miles per day; your maps need Einstein to work.

Gordon Moore predicted transistor density doubling in 1965; held true for 50+ years; physics hitting limits (transistors now 5nm—20 atoms wide); quantum tunneling breaks chips; we're approaching the end of exponential growth.
OLED Screens Burn Out Pixel by Pixel—Your Phone is Slowly Dying

Organic LEDs degrade with use; blue pixels die fastest (10,000 hours); why phone brightness decreases over years; static images cause "burn-in"; every OLED screen has a ticking clock.

Your Phone's Vibration Motor is a Tiny Off-Balance Weight Spinning 200 Times Per Second
Linear resonant actuators (LRAs) or eccentric rotating mass (ERM); spinning lopsided weight creates vibration; iPhone's Taptic Engine can simulate button clicks that don't exist; haptic feedback is controlled off-balance physics.


Airplane Mode Exists Because of a 1960s Conspiracy Theory—Not Real Danger
Original concern: phones might interfere with navigation (never proven); maintained because airlines wanted to sell onboard calls; modern planes immune to interference but we kept the rule; based on theoretical risk that never materialized.

Tier 5: Wi-Fi & Wireless Tech

Wi-Fi Was Invented by a Hollywood Actress Trying to Stop Nazi Torpedoes
1942: Hedy Lamarr and composer George Antheil patented "frequency hopping" to prevent radio jamming of Allied torpedoes; Navy ignored it; 1960s military rediscovered it; Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS all use her invention; beauty and brains stereotype destroyed.


Bluetooth is Named After a Viking King Who United Scandinavia With His Dead Tooth
King Harald "Bluetooth" Gormsson (958-986 AD) united Danish tribes; had a conspicuously dead/dark tooth; Bluetooth tech unites devices; logo is his initials in Nordic runes (ᚼ+ᛒ); 10th-century dentistry powers modern wireless.


Your Wi-Fi Router Broadcasts on the Same Frequency as Your Microwave
Both use 2.4 GHz; microwave ovens leak radiation; can interfere with Wi-Fi; why your internet slows when reheating leftovers; FCC allows 2.4 GHz for unlicensed use because it's the frequency water molecules vibrate at.
Wi-Fi Doesn't Stand for "Wireless Fidelity"—It Doesn't Stand for Anything
